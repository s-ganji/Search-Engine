# Search-Engine
Implementation of some parts of a search engine using Python programming language, Information Retrieval final course project, Spring 2019
## Part 1
At this stage of the project, you must fetch any news from the collection of input documents and take the necessary steps to create a reverse index. You must implement two cases with the following steps to index the collection of documents and build a dictionary:
- First case
1. Fetch news
2. Replace meaningless items such as numbers, html tags and punctuation marks such as question marks, exclamation marks, commas, etc. with a space.
3. Token extraction
4. Delete Stop words
5. Create reverse index
- Second case
1. Fetch news
2. Normalization
3. Token extraction
4. Stemming
5. Delete Stop words
6. Create reverse index Ÿê<br/>
<br/>
Examine the Zipf and Heaps rules on input documents, and compare the results of the two cases. <br/>
Consider the axes of the Zipf rule diagram log^rank, log^cf, and the axes of the Heaps rule diagram, log^T log^M.
